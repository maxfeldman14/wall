You can use "decoder.py" simply by placing it in the same directory of the program that will be importing it.
If you want it used with any Python program, anywhere on your disk you need to copy it into the Python's root directory:
/lib/%PythonRoot%/site-packages/
(The standard procedure)

Whatever your choice would be you will need the following files:
codecs.pdc (Optional)
decoder.py
fileinfo.py

If you don't have the Mutagen library already installed you will have to install it.
Use the setup.py file in the mutagen-1.19 directory.

If you don't have the apropriate external decoder(s) already, you will have to instal them.
You will need: lame, faad, flac, ffmpeg, oggdec.
To install them on Ubuntu/Debian use:
$ sudo
$ apt-get install lame
$ apt-get install faad
$ apt-get install flac
$ apt-get install ffmpeg
$ apt-get install vorbis-tools

On other Unix platforms, try to use their internet repository with application manager or download them from the internet and install using make.

Enjoy yourself!
